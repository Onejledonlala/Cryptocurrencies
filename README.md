## Overview of analysis

This analysis was performed to show what unsupervised learning is used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. The analysis diplays what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investment.

## Conclusion

Based on the two graphs above, most of the clusters are within the bottom-left. However, two points looks more outliners to the rest. Out of the two, the Class 2 shows its total coins mined almost equivalent to total coins supplied. Based on Hierarchy, using the dendrogram could show a higher horizontal line, the less similarity there is between the clusters.
